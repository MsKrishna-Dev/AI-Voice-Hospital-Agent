## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AI-Voice-Hospital-Agent.git
cd AI-Voice-Hospital-Agent
```
### 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment

```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Run Backend

## 🧠 How It Works

The Vapi voice agent processes natural language commands and triggers backend endpoints through webhooks.

The FastAPI backend:
- Validates input
- Performs database operations
- Returns structured JSON responses

The AI agent then converts those responses into conversational voice replies.
